# Ruby Catalog Of My Things

This is Ruby group capstone project where we created a console app that will help user to keep a record of different types of things won: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files but you will also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to your program's class structure.
